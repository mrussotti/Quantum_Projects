# Quantum Computer Simulator

Quantum Computer Simulator is an educational tool that allows users to simulate the behavior of a quantum computer on a classical computer. This simulator supports various single-qubit and multi-qubit gates, as well as measurement operations. 

## Features

- Supports single-qubit gates such as X, Y, Z, H, S, and T.
- Supports multi-qubit gates like CNOT.
- Provides the ability to measure qubits in different bases.
- Allows users to create custom quantum circuits.
- Simple command-line interface for defining and executing quantum circuits.
- Visualize the quantum circuits (Future feature).
- Simulate noisy quantum channels (Future feature).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/mrussotti/Quantum_Projects.git`
`cd Quantum_Projects/QuantumSimulator`


2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
`python3 -m venv quantum_simulator_env`
`source quantum_simulator_env/bin/activate`

3. Install the required libraries:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

To start the quantum simulator, run:
`python simulator.py`


Follow the instructions in the command-line interface to create your quantum circuits and execute them.

### Example

1. Start the simulator by running `python simulator.py`.
2. Enter the number of qubits for your quantum circuit.
3. Add gates to the qubits by specifying the gate name and target qubit index.
4. Type 'run' to execute the quantum circuit.
5. View the state of each qubit in the circuit.
